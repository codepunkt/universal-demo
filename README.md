# universal-demo

A react boilerplate with universal rendering, code splitting, hot module reloading and extracting component based css defined in javascript to it's own file whenever possible.

- run `npm i`
- run `npm run start`

### Current Problems

- Hot Module Reloading is broken.
- CommonChunks that are required in dynamic ones don't server render.
